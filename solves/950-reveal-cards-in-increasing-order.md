## 950. Reveal Cards In Increasing Order
[950 LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reveal-cards-in-increasing-order)

### Python
- Sort the deck array in descending order.
- Initialize an empty list to hold the final arrangement of the deck.
- Iterate through the sorted deck:
    - For each element, insert it at the beginning of the final arrangement list.
    - If the final arrangement list has more than one element, remove the last element and insert it at the beginning of the list.
- This reverse process simulates the revealing and reordering steps backward, giving the correct initial arrangement.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def deckRevealedIncreasing(self, deck):
        """
        :type deck: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        # Step 1: Sort the deck in descending order to simulate the process backwards
        deck.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Step 2: Initialize the arrangement list
        arrangement = []
        
        # Step 3: Iterate through the sorted deck
        for card in deck:
            if arrangement:
                # Move the last card to the front (simulate 'put the next top card at the bottom')
                arrangement.insert(0, arrangement.pop())
            # Reveal the card by inserting it at the front
            arrangement.insert(0, card)
        
        return arrangement
```
> This code effectively reverses the process of revealing and reordering the cards, ensuring the final arrangement allows for the cards to be revealed in increasing order. By starting with the highest card and working backward, we can place each card in such a way that the revealing process will order them correctly.

### Java
For the Java version, we'll apply a similar logic as discussed previously but adjusted for Java's syntax and type system. Here's a step-by-step implementation:

- Sort the input `deck` in ascending order.
- Use a Deque (double-ended queue) to simulate the process of revealing cards and placing the next top card at the bottom of the deck.
- Iterate through the sorted `deck` in reverse order, inserting elements to the front of the queue and then moving the previously front element to the back. This effectively simulates the process in reverse.
- Convert the Deque back to an array to return the result.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Deque;
import java.util.LinkedList;

class Solution {
    public int[] deckRevealedIncreasing(int[] deck) {
        // Step 1: Sort the deck in ascending order
        Arrays.sort(deck);
        
        // Step 2: Initialize the Deque to simulate the arrangement process
        Deque<Integer> deque = new LinkedList<>();
        
        // Step 3: Iterate through the deck in reverse order
        for (int i = deck.length - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (!deque.isEmpty()) {
                // Move the last element to the front to simulate the reordering
                deque.addFirst(deque.removeLast());
            }
            // Insert the current card at the front of the deque
            deque.addFirst(deck[i]);
        }
        
        // Step 4: Convert the deque back to an array
        int[] result = new int[deck.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < deck.length; ++i) {
            result[i] = deque.removeFirst();
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
/**
 * Reorders the deck to reveal cards in increasing order.
 * @param {number[]} deck - The deck of cards.
 * @return {number[]} - The reordered deck.
 */
var deckRevealedIncreasing = function(deck) {
    // Step 1: Sort the deck in ascending order
    deck.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    // Initialize an array to simulate the deck rearrangement process
    let rearranged = [];
    
    // Step 3: Iterate through the deck in reverse order
    for (let i = deck.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (rearranged.length > 1) {
            // Move the last card to the front to simulate the reveal process backwards
            rearranged.unshift(rearranged.pop());
        }
        // Insert the current card at the front
        rearranged.unshift(deck[i]);
    }
    
    // Return the rearranged deck
    return rearranged;
};
```

### Rust
For Rust, we will implement a solution that mirrors the logic applied in other languages, adapting it to Rust's unique syntax and ownership rules. Here's how you can do it:

- Sort the deck in ascending order.
- Use a `VecDeque` to efficiently simulate the reverse process of revealing cards and placing the next top card at the bottom of the deck.
- Iterate through the sorted deck in reverse order, simulating the process in reverse by inserting elements to the front of the VecDeque and moving the previously front element to the back.
- Convert the VecDeque back into a Vec to return the result.
Here's the Rust code implementing this approach:

```rust
use std::collections::VecDeque;

impl Solution {
    pub fn deck_revealed_increasing(mut deck: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
        // Step 1: Sort the deck in ascending order.
        deck.sort_unstable();
        
        // Step 2: Initialize the VecDeque to simulate the arrangement process.
        let mut deque: VecDeque<i32> = VecDeque::new();
        
        // Step 3: Iterate through the deck in reverse order.
        for &card in deck.iter().rev() {
            if let Some(rear) = deque.pop_back() {
                // Move the last element to the front to simulate the reordering.
                deque.push_front(rear);
            }
            // Insert the current card at the front of the deque.
            deque.push_front(card);
        }
        
        // Step 4: Convert the VecDeque back into a Vec to return.
        Vec::from(deque)
    }
}
```

### C#
This C# solution mirrors the logic previously explained:

- Sort the deck to know the final order of revealed cards.
- Use a queue to simulate revealing cards and moving the next top card to the bottom. Since the queue does not support inserting at the front directly, this simulation is done by first dequeuing an element and then enqueuing it again, effectively moving it to the bottom.
- Finally, reverse the process by filling an array from the queue in reverse order to get the initial configuration that allows revealing the cards in increasing order.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class Solution {
    public int[] DeckRevealedIncreasing(int[] deck) {
        // Step 1: Sort the deck in ascending order
        Array.Sort(deck);
        
        // Step 2: Initialize a queue to simulate the process
        Queue<int> queue = new Queue<int>();
        
        // Step 3: Iterate through the deck in reverse order
        for (int i = deck.Length - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (queue.Count > 0) {
                // Move the last element to the front to simulate the reordering
                queue.Enqueue(queue.Dequeue());
            }
            // Insert the current card at the front of the queue
            queue.Enqueue(deck[i]);
        }
        
        // Step 4: Reverse the queue to get the final arrangement
        int[] result = new int[deck.Length];
        for (int i = deck.Length - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            result[i] = queue.Dequeue();
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```
