# LeetCode Solutions: An AI Evolution Experiment

This repository is a machine learning science experiment exploring how multi-agent AI systems and deterministic code checks can improve algorithmic problem-solving through iteration. Rather than showcasing individual coding skills, this project demonstrates the evolution of AI capabilities in solving complex programming challenges.

## The AI Evolution Approach

As AI increasingly demonstrates proficiency in solving coding tasks, the key differentiator becomes the ability to effectively orchestrate, tune, and maintain AI systems for real-world applications. This repository provides full transparency about AI's role while highlighting the human expertise required in system design, prompt engineering, and quality assurance.

## Multi-Agent System Architecture

Solutions are generated through a specialized team of AI agents, each optimized for specific aspects of the problem-solving process:
