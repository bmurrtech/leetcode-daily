This repository is a machine learning science experiment exploring how multi-agent AI systems and deterministic code checks can improve algorithmic problem-solving through iteration. Rather than showcasing individual coding skills, this project demonstrates the evolution of AI capabilities in solving complex programming challenges.

## The AI Evolution Approach

As AI increasingly demonstrates proficiency in solving coding tasks, the key differentiator becomes the ability to effectively orchestrate, tune, and maintain AI systems for real-world applications. This repository provides full transparency about AI's role while highlighting the human expertise required in system design, prompt engineering, and quality assurance.

## Multi-Agent System Architecture

Solutions are generated through a specialized three-agent system powered by world-class LLMs. This architecture emphasizes clear role boundaries and iterative improvement:

### üé≠ Core Agents

- **Orchestrator**
  - Manages workflow coordination
  - Facilitates inter-agent communication
  - Documents optimization journey
  - Maintains context across iterations
  - Powered by state-of-the-art LLMs

- **Coder**
  - Handles code generation
  - Implements optimizations
  - Maintains code quality
  - Ensures best practices
  - Uses advanced code-specialized models

- **Reasoner**
  - Analyzes solution approaches
  - Evaluates performance implications
  - Identifies optimization opportunities
  - Validates implementation choices
  - Leverages reasoning-optimized LLMs

### üîÑ Workflow Pattern
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Problem Input] --> B[Orchestrator]
    B --> C[Coder: Generate Solution]
    C --> B
    B --> D[Compile & Execute Code]
    D --> B
    B --> E[Reasoner: Analyze Results]
    E --> B
    B --> F{Improvements Needed?}
    F -->|Yes| C
    F -->|No| G[Final Solution]
```

### üí° Core Philosophy

The system operates on a "storyteller" pattern where the Orchestrator maintains the narrative of optimization without directly modifying code. It synthesizes insights from:
- Coder ‚Üî Reasoner iterations
- Compilation results
- Performance analysis
- Implementation choices

This approach ensures that each solution includes not just the "what" but also the crucial "why" behind implementation decisions.
