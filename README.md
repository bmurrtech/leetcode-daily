This repository is a machine learning science experiment exploring how multi-agent AI systems and deterministic code checks can improve algorithmic problem-solving through iteration. Rather than showcasing individual coding skills, this project demonstrates the evolution of AI capabilities in solving complex programming challenges.

## The AI Evolution Approach

As AI increasingly demonstrates proficiency in solving coding tasks, the key differentiator becomes the ability to effectively orchestrate, tune, and maintain AI systems for real-world applications. This repository provides full transparency about AI's role while highlighting the human expertise required in system design, prompt engineering, and quality assurance.

## Multi-Agent System Architecture

Solutions are generated through a specialized team of AI agents powered by world-class LLMs from **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, **Google**, and leading **open-source** models. Each agent is optimized for specific aspects of the problem-solving process:

### ü§ñ Agent Specializations

- **Reasoning Models**: Complex problem analysis and optimization strategies
- **Coding Models**: Fast and accurate code generation with multiple language support
- **Quality Control Models**: Code review, validation, and optimization
- **Testing Models**: Comprehensive test case generation and edge case validation
- **Orchestration Models**: Context management and multi-agent coordination
- **Context Awareness Models**: Large-scale code understanding and integration

- **Rust** integration for secure code compilation and execution
- **E2B Code Interpreter** as fallback sandbox for code testing
- **WebAssembly (WASM)** runtime for isolated code execution
- **Multi-agent orchestration** with specialized task-specific models

### Key Libraries & Technologies
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI, Anthropic, and Fal.ai client libraries
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic v2 with advanced type checking
- **HTTP & API**: HTTPX for async requests, FastAPI for endpoints
- **Code Quality**: Ruff, Black, and MyPy for formatting and linting
- **Reliability**: Tenacity for retry logic and error handling
- **Testing**: Pytest with asyncio support and coverage reporting

**OptiCodeGen Engine Credits**: The sophisticated multi-agent AI system that powers all solutions in this repository was developed and is maintained by me. This private API handles code generation, quality assurance, iterative improvement, compilation, and testing - funded entirely at my own expense using world-class LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Without this engine, none of these automated solutions would be possible.
